# Project Title: Visualization of Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Single-Source Shortest Path) through Animation.


# Features & Description
In Dijkstra’s Algorithm, we aim to find the shortest path weights (and the actual paths) from a particular single-source vertex to all other vertices in an undirected weighted graph (if such paths exist).
The best way to understand any complex algorithm is to see them in action. We've developed interactive animations of Dijkstra’s Algorithm for better understanding.

Given an undirected graph as input, it will draw the shortest path step by step.
